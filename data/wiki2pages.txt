After graduating, Freedman returned to [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], where he was a lecturer in the department of mathematics until 1975.  He left Berkeley to become a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (IAS) in Princeton. In 1976 he was appointed assistant professor in the department of mathematics at the [[University of California, San Diego]].
