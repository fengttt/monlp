You are given a user query.  You can search a knowledge base to retrieve
information about a topic.  You can rephrase or decompose the original 
user query into small steps. In each step you can search some topics 
in the knowledge base and ask a subquery.  Only ask simple subqueries 
because the knowledge base is not capable of complex reasoning.
Given the information and answers from previous steps, generate more
steps that can help to finally answer the original user query.

## Topics Retrieved From Previous Steps
    {{.Topics}}

## Subqueries and Answers From Previouis Steps
    {{.Subqueries}}

## Original User Query
    {{.UserQuery}}

You should format the generated steps in the following json format.
For example, if you want to generate two more steps, 
[
    {
        "topics": ["Topic X", "Topic Y"],
        "subquery": "The subquery in step one"
    },
    {
        "topics": ["Topic Z"],
        "subquery": "The subquery in step two",
    }
]
